 Description    « Hide
When using the admin tool, if an error occurs for some reason - let's say the database for a node you are loading doesn't exist - the node has already been added to the configuration database, but has not been initialized with the replication schema. There should be an easy way to initialize specific nodes without modifying the configuration database.

There is a workaround for this. Submit the XML file for the nodes you need to have initialized, and use "-operation UPDATE" command line option. This will cause the node metadata to be updated in the configuration database, and then initialize the node.

Moving this to the next release. There is a reasonable work around for the problem that has no identifiable problems.
