Problem: Bruce daemon code uses non-SQL standard escapes for some queries

This warning is issued in the postgresql log when the query is executed:

"nonstandard use of \ in a string literal at character NUM"

This only occurs against Pg 8.2.X.

Workaround:

Set escape_string_warning = off in postgresql.conf

I was musing over what we did during the bipp migration for the common
scripts we used. It just occurred to me, escape string syntax 'E' takes
care of the issue and you'd be compatible in both versions.

i.e. select E'foo\'bar'

and even if there is no escape, that's not a problem

"nonstandard use of \....." should only be showing up in 8.2.X databases
(which db-bipp is). In some future release, postgres will stop accepting
the backslash format of escape, and only support the SQL standard
(E'foo'). This warning is against FUTURE incompatibility. However, in
8.1.X, the SQL standard is not supported. The only common escape format
between the two versions is the backslash version.

Thus, the only way to have Bruce work against both versions of the
database will generate this warning on the 8.2.X database.

The warning can be suppressed by setting escape_string_warning = off in
postgresql.conf

Bob, can would you take a look at this. They are coming from Bruce:
