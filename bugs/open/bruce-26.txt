 Description    « Hide
Feature request received via IM.

requestor:
idea is to compare table list versus regex at daemon slae thread startup
and before doing anything else
make the triggers match the regex
raklahn:
I think thats a really good idea. The regex idea has gone over less than well with some on the Ops team, but I like the idea that one 'thing' be the database of record for what is replicated, and that it be external to the database in qustion.
requestor:
cool. pretty sure mysql replication does it the same way, except it uses that regex against the sql statements that it ships.
so lots of users outside connexus should be familiar withthat.
raklahn:
Yea, this whole idea for a regex came from MySQL's use of it.
requestor:
true, remembering that now.
