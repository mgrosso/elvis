 Description    « Hide
Daemon never finds the snapshot for the 2nd or greater cluster. Query in question

select * from bruce.slavesnapshotstatus where slave_xaction = (select max(slave_xaction) from bruce.slavesnapshotstatus) and clusterid = $1

The subselect is unnessasary (clusterid is the primary key), and because of the subselect, never finds a row.
