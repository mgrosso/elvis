 Description    « Hide
Currently postgres.properties defines the postgresql.port property. But not all build targets seem to use this property. Also it will be nice to have this property overridden by the environment so that in a multiuser environment, users can still build without having to change the property file and stepping on each other's builds.

The build will succeed with a port override using -Dpostgresql.port=XXXX on the command line. E.g.

$ ant -Dpostgresql.port=15432 clean test-reports

This command will build the system, run all unit tests against the postgres server on port 15432 and generate reports.

Currently, there are a number (~15) of unit test failures that appear related to the port change. Those still need to be fixed.
