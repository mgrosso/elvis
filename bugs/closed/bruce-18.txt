portaldb=# select bruce.logsnapshot();
ERROR: value "2147683487" is out of range for type integer

Problem is in the logsnapshot() function, where its using INT4OID where it should use INT8OID........

Also a problem in the daemon. The "next snapshot wraparound" query is incorrect. It should be:

select * from bruce.snapshotlog where current_xaction not in (?,?,?) and ((current_xaction >= ? and current_xaction <= ?) or (current_xaction >= ? and current_xaction <= ?)) order by current_xaction desc limit 1

Fix (to the extension problem):

http://svn.bruce.codehaus.org/changelog/bruce/?cs=94
and
http://svn.bruce.codehaus.org/changelog/bruce/?cs=96

Workaround (to the daemon problem):

Pass:

'-Dbruce.slave.nextSnapshotWraparound=select current_xaction,min_xaction,max_xaction,outstanding_xactions,update_time from bruce.snapshotlog where current_xaction not in (?,?,?) and ((current_xaction >= ? and current_xaction <= ?) or (current_xaction >= ? and current_xaction <= ?)) order by current_xaction desc limit 1'

to the java command line.

Fix (to the daemon problem):

TBD
